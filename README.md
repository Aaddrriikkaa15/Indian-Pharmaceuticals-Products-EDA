**Key Insights :**

1. The Indian pharma market shows high product diversity, with significant price spread across brands and pack sizes.
2. Bulk pack sizes generally lower the per-unit cost but that does not guarantee low total price of the pack.
3. Brand positioning and manufacturer reputation has a strong influence in pricing strategies.
4. Critical disease treatment medicines serve as outliers here as they can be very expensive and not everyday usage drugs.
