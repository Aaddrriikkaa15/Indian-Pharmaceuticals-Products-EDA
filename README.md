The dataset, indian_pharmaceutical_products_clean.csv, contains structured information on over 250,000 Indian pharmaceutical products. It includes:
1. Medicine Name: Generic or brand name of the product.
2. Price (INR): Retail price in Indian Rupees.
3. Manufacturer: Company or brand producing the product.
4. Packaging Details: Text describing the pack type and size (e.g., “10 tablets per strip”).
5. Active Ingredients: Main chemical compounds in the product.
The dataset has been cleaned and standardized, ensuring consistent manufacturer names, normalized pack size, and usable numeric fields for analysis. 


**Key Insights :**

1. The Indian pharma market shows high product diversity, with significant price spread across brands and pack sizes.
2. Bulk pack sizes generally lower the per-unit cost but that does not guarantee low total price of the pack.
3. Brand positioning and manufacturer reputation has a strong influence in pricing strategies.
4. Critical disease treatment medicines serve as outliers here as they can be very expensive and not everyday usage drugs.
